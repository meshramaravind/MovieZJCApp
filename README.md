# Setup Requirements
First, obtain your API key from TMDB and add it in a file named apikey.properties within the root directory:
YOUR_API_KEY="****"


Then, replace it in the build.gradle(:app) :
...
buildConfigField("String", "YOUR_API_KEY", apikeyProperties['YOUR_API_KEY'])

Finally, rebuild the project for changes to take effect and don't forget to update the references of this key in the APIService.kt file.
...
@Query("api_key") apiKey: String = BuildConfig.YOUR_API_KEY,
